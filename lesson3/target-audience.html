            <h3>Persona 1</h3>
            <p>
                Napoleon is a young adult male residing in Preston, Idaho. He has some college education.
                He has little knowledge on the subject of weather and weather forecasting. He needs to regularly check
                the weather forecast every few days to see the predicted weather to see if any storms are coming.
                Napoleon primarily will view the site on a standard desktop computer.

            <h3>Persona 2</h3>
            <p>
                Aubrey is an older female visiting Fish Haven, Idaho. She has completed higher level education.
                She is somewhat knowledgable in weather and weather forecasts. She wants to check the current weather
                at a moment's notice to see if the day will be good for fishing or boating with her husband. She wants
                live statistics on current temperature, wind speed, wind direction, air pressure, and sky conditions.
